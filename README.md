# StochasticCellularAutomata
In the summer of 2017 for school coursework I wrote a long essay about simulating the spread of disease in the US. I also wrote an accompanying Python model that used stochastic cellular automata and treated the USA as a grid of 48 (mainland) individual state-entities to carry out some simulations. Using what I learnt in the time since then, I remade it in a few days of the summer of 2021.

The original program is a single buggy file, 2000 lines long, while the updated version is only a couple of hundred lines of code split across several files.

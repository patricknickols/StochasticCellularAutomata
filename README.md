# StochasticCellularAutomata
In the summer of 2017 for school coursework I wrote a long essay about simulating the spread of disease in the US. I also wrote an accompanying Python model that used stochastic cellular automata and treated the USA as a grid of 48 (mainland) individual state-entities to carry out some simulations. Upon reflection, the whole project has many issues from poor coding practices to missing mathematical insights and now I want to do it better.
